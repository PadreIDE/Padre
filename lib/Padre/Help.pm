=head1 NAME

Padre::Help - Padre Help Provider API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Padre::Help> class provides a base class, default implementation
and API documentation for help provision support in L<Padre>.

In order to setup a help system for a document type called C<XYZ> one has to do the following:
Create a module called C<Padre::Help::XYZ> that subclasses the C<Padre::Help> module
and override 3 methods: C<help_init>, C<help_list> and C<help_render>.

In the class representing the Document (C<Padre::Document::XYZ>) one should override the
C<get_help_provider> method and return an object of the help provide module.
In our case it should contain

	require Padre::Help::XYZ;
	return Padre::Help::XYZ->new;

(TO DO: Maybe it should only return the name of the module)

The C<help_init> method is called by the new method of C<Padre::Help> once for every
document of C<XYZ> kind. (TO DO: maybe it should be only once for every document type, and not
once for every document of that type).

C<help_list> should return a reference to an array holding the possible strings the system can
provide help for.

C<help_render> is called by one of the keywords, it should return the HTML to be displayed
as help and another string which is the location of the help. Usually a path to a file
that will be used in the title of the window.
