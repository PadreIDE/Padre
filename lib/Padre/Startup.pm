=head1 NAME

Padre::Startup - Padre start-up related configuration settings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Padre stores host-related data in a combination of an easily transportable
YAML file for personal settings and a powerful and robust SQLite-based
configuration database for host settings and state data.

Unfortunately, fully loading and validating these configurations can be
relatively expensive and may take some time. A limited number of these
settings need to be available extremely early in the Padre bootstrapping
process.

The F<startup.yml> file is automatically written at the same time as the
regular configuration files, and is read without validating during early start-up.

L<Padre::Startup::Config> is a small convenience module for reading and
writing the F<startup.yml> file.
