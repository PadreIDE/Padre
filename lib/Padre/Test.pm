package Padre::Test;

# This package should be loaded by your test script (or by -MPadre::Test)
# to signal that Padre is running inside of a test script, and should
# behave appropriately.
#
# To avoid problems with the test environment not matching the run-time
# environment (and as a result missing bugs because the tests don't work
# quite the same as the real thing) uses of this module should be limited
# to highly user-impacting changes, like keeping the Padre window invisible
# during tests.

# In Padre code, the existance of $Padre::Test::VERSION is suitable for
# assuming we are in the test suite.
