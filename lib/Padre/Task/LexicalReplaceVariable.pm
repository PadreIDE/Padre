=head1 NAME

Padre::Task::LexicalReplaceVariable - Lexically variable replace using L<PPI>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $replacer = Padre::Task::LexicalReplaceVariable->new(
          document    => $document_obj,
          location    => [ $line, $column ], # the position of *any* occurrence of the variable
          replacement => '$foo',
  );
  $replacer->schedule;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a location in the document (line/column), determines the name of the
variable at this position, finds where the variable was defined,
and B<lexically> replaces all occurrences with another variable.

The replacement can either be provided explicitly by the user (using the
C<replacement> option) or the user may set the C<to_camel_case> or
C<from_camel_case> options. In that case the variable will be converted
to/from camel case. With the latter options, C<ucfirst> will force the
upper-casing of the first letter (as is typical with global variables).
