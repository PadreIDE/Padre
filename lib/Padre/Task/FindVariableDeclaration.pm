=head1 NAME

Padre::Task::FindVariableDeclaration - Finds where a variable was declared using L<PPI>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Find declaration of variable at cursor
  my $task = Padre::Task::FindVariableDeclaration->new(
          document => $document_obj,
          location => [ $line, $column ], # ppi-style location is okay, too
  );

  $task->schedule;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finds out where a variable has been declared.
If unsuccessful, a message box tells the user about
that glorious fact. If a declaration is found, the cursor will jump to it.
