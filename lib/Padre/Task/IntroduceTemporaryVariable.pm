=head1 NAME

Padre::Task::IntroduceTemporaryVariable - Introduces a temporary variable using L<PPI>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $tempvarmaker = Padre::Task::IntroduceTemporaryVariable->new(
          document       => $document_obj,
          start_location => [$line, $column], # or just character position
          end_location   => [$line, $column], # or ppi-style location
          varname        => '$foo',
  );

  $tempvarmaker->schedule;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a region of code within a statement, replaces that code with a temporary variable.
Declares and initializes the temporary variable right above the statement that included the selected
expression.

Usually, you simply set C<start_position> to what C<< $editor->GetSelectionStart >> returns
and C<end_position> to C<< $editor->GetSelectionEnd - 1 >>.

			varname        => $self->{varname},
		);

		$self->{error} = $@;
		return;
	}

	# TO DO: passing this back and forth is probably hyper-inefficient, but such is life.
	$self->{munged}   = $munged->code;
	$self->{location} = $munged->element->location;
