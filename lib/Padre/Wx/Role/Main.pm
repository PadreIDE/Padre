=head1 NAME

Padre::Wx::Role::Main - Convenience methods for children of the main window

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role implements the fairly common method pattern for Wx elements that
are children of L<Padre::Wx::Main>.

It provides accessors for easy access to the most commonly needed elements,
and shortcut integration with the L<Padre::Current> context system.

=head1 METHODS

use strict;

our $VERSION = '1.02';

=pod

=head2 C<ide>

    my $ide = $object->ide;

Get the L<Padre> IDE instance that this object is a child of.

=cut

sub ide {
	shift->main->ide;
}

=pod

=head2 C<config>

    my $config = $object->config;

Get the L<Padre::Config> for the current user. Provided mainly as a
convenience because it is needed so often.

Please note that this method does NOT integrate with the L<Padre::Current>
context system. Any project-specific configuration of overrides of default
behaviour will not be present in this configuration object.

For a project-aware configuration, use the following instead.

  $self->current->config;

=cut

sub config {
	shift->main->config;
}

=pod

=head2 C<main>

    my $main = $object->main;

Get the L<Padre::Wx::Main> main window that this object is a child of.

=cut

sub main {
	my $main = Wx::GetTopLevelParent(shift);
	return $main if Params::Util::_INSTANCE( $main, 'Padre::Wx::Main' );
	return $main->GetParent;
}

=pod

=head2 C<aui>

    my $aui = $object->aui;

Convenient access to the Wx Advanced User Interface (AUI) Manager object.

=cut

sub aui {
	shift->main->aui;
}

=pod

=head2 current

    my $current = $object->current;

Get a new C<Padre::Current> context object, for access to other parts of
the current context.

=cut

sub current {
	Padre::Current->new( main => shift->main );
}

=pod

=head2 lock_update

    my $lock = $object->lock_update;

The L<Padre::Locker> API in Padre provides a solid and extensible system for
locking of IDE resources when large-scale change of state is to occur.

Unfortunately, there are some cases in which this mechanism can cause problems.

Window update locking using this API is done on the entire main window. The
resulting C<Freeze>/C<Thaw> calls are recursive on Windows, and as C<Thaw> calls
invalidate the painted state of widgets, this results in a global redraw and
on the non-double-bufferred Windows platform this causes flickering.

When a piece of code is making very targetted changes to just the graphical
state of the application and will only need an UPDATE lock (i.e. does not need
refresh or database locks) the alternative C<lock_update> method provides a
convenience for creating a L<Wx::WindowUpdateLocker> independant of the main
locking API.

By using a localised lock and avoiding a global update lock, this should
remove global flickering on these changes, and limit flickering to just
the element being update, which should be much less noticable.

sub lock_update {
	Wx::WindowUpdateLocker->new( $_[0] );
