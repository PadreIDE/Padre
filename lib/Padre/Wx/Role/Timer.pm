=head1 NAME

Padre::Wx::Role::Timer - Convenience methods for working with Wx timers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role implements a set of methods for letting L<Wx> objects in Padre
implement dwell events on elements that do not otherwise natively
support them.

In this initial simplified implementation, we support only one common
dwell event for each combination of object class and dwell method.

If multiple instances of a class are used, then the timer id will collide
across multiple timers and unexpected behaviour may occur.

# Dwell Interface Methods

=pod

=head2 dwell_start

  # Half second dwell timer on a text input
  $wx_object->dwell_start( on_text => 500 );

The C<dwell_start> method starts (or restarts) the dwell timer.

It has two required parameters of the method to call, and the amount of
time (in thousands of a second) that the event should be delayed.

Note that when the dwell-delayed event is actually called, it will NOT be
passed the original Wx event object. The method will be called directly
and with no parameters.

Please note that calling this method will result in the creating of a
L<Wx::Timer> object in an object HASH slot that matches the name of the
method.

As a result, if you wish to create a dwell to a method "foo" you may never
make use of the C<$wx_object-E<gt>{foo}> slot on that object.

=cut

sub dwell_start {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $method = shift;
	my $msec   = shift;

	# If this is the first time the dwell event is being called
	# create the timer object to support the dwell.
	unless ( $self->{$method} ) {

		# Fetch a usable id for the timer
		my $name = ref($self) . '::' . $method;
		my $id = ( $ID{$name} or $ID{$name} = Wx::NewId() );

		# Create the reusable timer object
		$self->{$method} = Wx::Timer->new( $self, $id );
		Wx::Event::EVT_TIMER(
			$self, $id,
			sub {
				$self->$method() if $self->can($method);
			},
		);
	}

	# Start (or restart) the dwell timer.
	$self->{$method}->Start( $msec, Wx::TIMER_ONE_SHOT );
}

=pod

=head2 dwell_stop

  $wx_object->dwell_stop( 'on_text' );

The C<dwell_stop> method prevents a single named dwell event from firing,
if there is a timer underway.

If there is no dwell for the named event the method will silently succeed.

=cut

sub dwell_stop {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $method = shift;
	if ( $self->{$method} ) {
		$self->{$method}->Stop;
	}
	return 1;
}

# Poll Interface Methods

sub poll_start {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $method = shift;
	my $msec   = shift;

	# If this is the first time the dwell event is being called
	# create the timer object to support the alarm.
	unless ( $self->{$method} ) {

		# Fetch a usable id for the timer
		my $name = ref($self) . '::' . $method;
		my $id = ( $ID{$name} or $ID{$name} = Wx::NewId() );

		# Create the reusable timer object
		$self->{$method} = Wx::Timer->new( $self, $id );
		Wx::Event::EVT_TIMER(
			$self, $id,
			sub {
				$self->$method();
			},
		);
	}

	# Start (or restart) the polling timer.
	$self->{$method}->Start( $msec, 0 );
}

sub poll_stop {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $method = shift;
	if ( $self->{$method} ) {
		$self->{$method}->Stop;
	}
	return 1;
}
