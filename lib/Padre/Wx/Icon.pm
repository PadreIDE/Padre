# It turns out that icon management needs to be more complex than just
# a few utility functions in Padre::Wx, and that it needs an entire
# library of its own.

# This library attempts to integrate padre with the freedesktop.org
# icon specifications using a highly limited and mostly
# wrong implementation of the algorithms they describe.
# http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec
# http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec

# Initially we only support the use of icons in directories bundled
# with Padre. Later, we'll probably be forced by distro-packagers and
# users to support integration with system icon themes.
