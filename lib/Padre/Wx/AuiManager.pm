# This is so wrong that I am even reluctant to describe it.
# We're seeing occasional double-frees from the Wx::AuiManager
# DESTROY XSUB. That will give a segmentation fault during
# global destruction.
# Now, I failed to track down WHY perl tries to call DESTROY
# multiple times. Maybe it's related to Class::Adapter::Builder,
# but I don't want to go around pointing fingers.
# What we'll do below is trade the SEGV for a small leak.
# We check whether the specific object at hand had been
# DESTROYed earlier and if so, we do nothing. If it hasn't been
# DESTROYed yet, we mark it as an ex-AUIManager and proceed to
# call the DESTROY XSUB.
# You may be appropriately appalled now. --Steffen

# PS: Uncomment those lines for getting a "manual" stack
#     trace. Calling cluck() or similar during global destruction
#     won't work.
# PPS: Anybody who manages to fix this for real AND explain to me
#      what the HELL is happening will get a beer on the next
#      occasion!
