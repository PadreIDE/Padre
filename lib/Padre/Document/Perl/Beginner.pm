=head1 NAME

Padre::Document::Perl::Beginner - naive implementation of some beginner specific error checking

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Padre::Document::Perl::Beginner;
  my $beginner = Padre::Document::Perl::Beginner->new;
  if (not $beginner->check($data)) {
      warn $beginner->error;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a naive implementation. It needs to be replaced by one using L<PPI>.

In Perl 5 there are lots of pitfalls the unaware, especially
the beginner can easily fall in. While some might expect the Perl
compiler itself would catch those it does not (yet ?) do it. So we took the
initiative and added a beginners mode to Padre in which these extra issues
are checked. Some are real problems that would trigger an error anyway
we just make them a special case with a more specific error message.
(e.g. C<use warning;> without the trailing s)
Others are valid code that can be useful in the hands of a master but that
are poisonous when written by mistake by someone who does not understand them.
(e.g. C<if ($x = /value/) { }> ).


This module provides a method called C<check> that can check a Perl script
(provided as parameter as a single string) and recognize problematic code.

=item *

  split /,/, @data;

Here @data is in scalar context returning the number of elements. Spotted in this form:

  split /,/, @ARGV;

=cut

  use warning;

s is missing at the end.

		$self->_report( "You need to write use warnings (with an s at the end) and not use warning.", $1 );
		return;
	}

=item *

  map { $_; } (@items),$extra_item;

is the same as

  map { $_; } (@items,$extra_item);

but you usually want

  (map { $_; } (@items)),$extra_item;

which means: map all C<@items> and them add C<$extra_item> without mapping it.

=cut

  map { s/foo/bar/; } (@items);

This returns an array containing true or false values (s/// - return value).

Use

  map { s/foo/bar/; $_; } (@items);

to actually change the array via s///.

=head1 HOW TO ADD ANOTHER ONE

Please feel free to add as many checks as you like. This is done in three steps:

=head2 Add the test

Add one (or more) tests for this case to F<t/75-perl-beginner.t>

The test should be successful when your supplied sample fails the check and
returns the correct error message. As texts of error messages may change,
try to match a good part which allows identification of the message but
don't match the very exact text.

Tests could use either one-liners written as strings within the test file or
external support files. There are samples for both ways in the test script.

=head2 Add the check

Add the check to the check-sub of this file (F<Document/Perl/Beginner.pm>). There
are plenty samples here. Remember to add a sample (and maybe short description)
what would fail the test.

Run the test script to match your test case(s) to the new check.

=head2 Add the configuration option

Go to F<Config.pm>, look for the beginner error checks configuration and add a new
setting for your new check there. It defaults to 1 (run the check), but a user
could turn it off by setting this to 0 within the Padre configuration file.
