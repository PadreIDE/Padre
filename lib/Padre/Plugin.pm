# Static Methods

=head1 STATIC/CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<plugin_name>

The C<plugin_name> method will be called by Padre when it needs a name
to display in the user interface.

The default implementation will generate a name based on the class name
of the plug-in.

=cut

sub plugin_name {
	my $class = ref $_[0] || $_[0];
	my @words = $class =~ /(\w+)/gi;
	my $name = pop @words;
	$name =~ s/([a-z])([A-Z])/$1 $2/g;
	$name =~ s/([A-Z]+)([A-Z][a-z]+)/$1 $2/g;
	return $name;
}

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_directory_share>

The C<plugin_directory_share> method finds the location of the shared
files directory for the plug-in, if one exists.

Returns a path string if the share directory exists, or C<undef> if not.

=cut

sub plugin_directory_share {
	my $class = shift;
	$class =~ s/::/-/g;
	$class =~ s/\=HASH\(.+?\)$//;

	if ( $ENV{PADRE_DEV} ) {
		my $bin = do {
			no warnings;
			require FindBin;
			$FindBin::Bin;
		};
		my $root = File::Spec->catdir(
			$bin,
			File::Spec->updir,
			File::Spec->updir,
			$class,
		);
		my $path = File::Spec->catdir( $root, 'share' );
		return $path if -d $path;
		$path = File::Spec->catdir(
			$root,
			'lib',
			split( /-/, $class ),
			'share',
		);
		return $path if -d $path;
		return;
	}

	# Find the distribution directory
	my $dist = eval { File::ShareDir::dist_dir($class) };
	return $@ ? undef : $dist;
}

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_directory_locale>

The C<plugin_directory_locale()> method will be called by Padre to
know where to look for your plug-in l10n catalog.

It defaults to F<$sharedir/locale> (with C<$sharedir> as defined by
C<File::ShareDir> and thus should work as is for your plug-in if you're
using the C<install_share> command of L<Module::Install>. If you are
using L<Module::Build> version 0.36 and later, please use the C<share_dir>
new() argument.

Your plug-in catalogs should be named F<$plugin-$locale.po> (or F<.mo>
for the compiled form) where C<$plugin> is the class name of your plug-in with
any character that are illegal in file names (on all file systems)
flattened to underscores.

That is, F<Padre__Plugin__Vi-de.po> for the German locale of
C<Padre::Plugin::Vi>.

=cut

sub plugin_directory_locale {
	my $class = shift;
	my $share = $class->plugin_directory_share or return;
	return File::Spec->catdir( $share, 'locale' );
}

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_icon>

The C<plugin_icon> method will be called by Padre when it needs an
icon to display in the user interface. It should return a 16x16
C<Wx::Bitmap> object.

The default implementation will look for an icon at the path
F<$plugin_directory_share/icons/16x16/logo.png> and load it for you.

=cut

sub plugin_icon {
	my $class = shift;
	my $share = $class->plugin_directory_share or return;
	my $file  = File::Spec->catfile( $share, 'icons', '16x16', 'logo.png' );
	return unless -f $file;
	return unless -r $file;
	return Wx::Bitmap->new( $file, Wx::BITMAP_TYPE_PNG );
}

=pod

=head2 C<padre_interfaces>

  sub padre_interfaces {
      'Padre::Plugin'         => 0.43,
      'Padre::Document::Perl' => 0.35,
      'Padre::Wx::Main'       => 0.43,
      'Padre::DB'             => 0.25,
  }

In Padre, plug-ins are permitted to make relatively deep calls into
Padre's internals. This allows a lot of freedom, but comes at the cost
of allowing plug-ins to damage or crash the editor.

To help compensate for any potential problems, the Plug-in Manager expects each
plug-in module to define the Padre classes that the plug-in uses, and the version
of Padre that the code was originally written against (for each class).

This information will be used by the Plug-in Manager to calculate whether or
not the plug-in is still compatible with Padre.

The list of interfaces should be provided as a list of class/version
pairs, as shown in the example.

The padre_interfaces method will be called on the class, not on the plug-in
object. By default, this method returns nothing.

In future, plug-ins that do B<not> supply compatibility information may be
disabled unless the user has specifically allowed experimental plug-ins.

=cut

# Disabled so that we can detect plugins created before the existance
# of the compatibility mechanism.
# sub padre_interfaces {
#     return ();
# }

# Convenience integration with Class::Unload
sub unload {
	my $either = shift;
	foreach my $package (@_) {
		require Padre::Unload;
		Padre::Unload->unload($package);
	}
	return 1;
}

# Default Constructor

=pod

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 C<new>

The new constructor takes no parameters. When a plug-in is loaded,
Padre will instantiate one plug-in object for each plug-in, to provide
the plug-in with a location to store any private or working data.

A default constructor is provided that creates an empty hash-based
object.

=cut

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	my $ide   = shift;
	unless ( Params::Util::_INSTANCE( $ide, 'Padre' ) ) {
		Carp::croak("Did not provide a Padre ide object");
	}

	# Create the basic object
	my $self = bless {}, $class;

	# Store the link back to the IDE
	$IDE{ Scalar::Util::refaddr($self) } = $ide;

	return $self;
}

sub DESTROY {
	delete $IDE{ Scalar::Util::refaddr( $_[0] ) };
}

# Instance Methods

=pod

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 C<registered_documents>

  sub registered_documents {
      'application/javascript' => 'Padre::Plugin::JavaScript::Document',
      'application/json'       => 'Padre::Plugin::JavaScript::Document',
  }

The C<registered_documents> method can be used by a plug-in to define
document types for which the plug-in provides a document class
(which is used by Padre to enable functionality beyond the level of
a plain text file with simple Scintilla highlighting).

This method will be called by the Plug-in Manager and the information returned
will be used to populate various internal data structures and perform various
other tasks. Plug-in authors are expected to provide this information without
having to know how or why Padre will use it.

This (theoretically at this point) should allow Padre to keep a document open
while a plug-in is being enabled or disabled, upgrading or downgrading the
document in the process.

The method call is made on the plug-in object, and returns a list of
MIME type to class pairs. By default the method returns a null list,
which indicates that the plug-in does not provide any document types.

=cut

sub registered_documents {
	return ();
}

=head2 C<registered_highlighters>

    sub registered_highlighters {
        'Padre::Plugin::MyPlugin::Perl' => {
            name => _T("My Highlighter"),
            mime => [ qw{
                application/x-perl
                application/x-perl6
                text/x-pod
            } ],
        },
        'Padre::Plugin::MyPlugin::C' => {
            name => _T("My Highlighter"),
            mime => [ qw{
                text/x-csrc
                text/x-c++src
                text/x-perlxs
            } ],
        },
    }

The C<registered_documents> method can be used by a plug-in to define custom
syntax highlighters for use with one or more MIME types.

As shown in the example above, highlighters are described as a module name
and an attribute that describes a visible name for the highlighter and a
reference to a list of the mime types that the highlighter should be applied
to.

Defining a new syntax highlighter will automatically cause that
highlighter to be used by default for the MIME type.

=cut

sub registered_highlighters {
	return ();
}

=pod

=head2 C<event_on_context_menu>

  sub event_on_context_menu {
    my ($self, $document, $editor, $menu, $event) = (@_);
    
    # create our own menu section
    $menu->AppendSeparator;

    my $item = $menu->Append( -1, _T('Mutley, do something') );
    Wx::Event::EVT_MENU(
        $self->main,
        $item,
        sub { Wx::MessageBox('sh sh sh sh', 'Mutley', Wx::OK, shift) },
    );
  }

If implemented in a plug-in, this method will be called when a
context menu is about to be displayed either because the user
triggered the event right in the editor window (with a right click
or Shift+F10 or the context menu key) or because the C<Context Menu>
menu entry was selected in the C<Window> menu (C<Wx::CommandEvent>).
The context menu object was created and populated by the Editor and
then possibly augmented by the C<Padre::Document> type
(see L<Padre::Document/event_on_context_menu>).

Parameters retrieved are the objects for the document, the editor, the
context menu (C<Wx::Menu>) and the event.

Have a look at the implementation in L<Padre::Document::Perl> for
a more thorough example, including how to manipulate the active document.

=cut

# this method is only implemented in the plug-in children

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_enable>

The C<plugin_enable> object method will be called (at an arbitrary time of Padre's
choosing) to allow the plug-in object to initialise and start up the plug-in.

This may involve loading any configuration files, hooking into existing documents or
editor windows, and otherwise doing anything needed to bootstrap operations.

Please note that Padre will block until this method returns, so you should
attempt to complete return as quickly as possible.

Any modules that you may use should B<not> be loaded during this phase, but should
be C<require>ed when they are needed, at the last moment.

Returns true if the plug-in started up successfully, or false on failure.

The default implementation does nothing, and returns true.

=cut

sub plugin_enable {
	return 1;
}

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_disable>

The C<plugin_disable> method is called by Padre for various reasons to request
the plug-in do whatever tasks are necessary to shut itself down. This also
provides an opportunity to save configuration information, save caches to
disk, and so on.

Most often, this will be when Padre itself is shutting down. Other uses may
be when the user wishes to disable the plug-in, when the plug-in is being
reloaded, or if the plug-in is about to be upgraded.

If you have any private classes other than the standard C<Padre::Plugin::Foo>,
you should unload them as well as the plug-in may be in the process of upgrading
and will want those classes freed up for use by the new version.

The recommended way of unloading your extra classes is using the built in
C<unload> method. Suppose you have C<My::Extra::Class> and want to unload it,
simply do this in C<plugin_disable>:

  $plugin->unload('My::Extra::Class');

The C<unload> method takes care of all the tedious bits for you. Note that you
should B<not> unload any external C<CPAN> dependencies, as these may be needed
by other plug-ins or Padre itself. Only classes that are part of your plug-in
should be unloaded.

Returns true on success, or false if the unloading process failed and your
plug-in has been left in an unknown state.

=cut

sub plugin_disable {
	return 1;
}

=pod

=head2 C<config_read>

  my $hash = $self->config_read;
  if ( $hash ) {
      print "Loaded existing configuration\n";
  } else {
      print "No existing configuration";
  }

The C<config_read> method provides access to host-specific configuration
stored in a persistent location by Padre.

At this time, the configuration must be a nested, non-cyclic structure of
C<HASH> references, C<ARRAY> references and simple scalars (the use of
C<undef> values is permitted) with a C<HASH> reference at the root.

Returns a nested C<HASH>-root structure if there is an existing saved
configuration for the plug-in, or C<undef> if there is no existing saved
configuration for the plug-in.

=cut

sub config_read {
	my $self = shift;

	# Retrieve the config string from the database
	my $class = Scalar::Util::blessed($self);

	#convert p-p-xx-yy -> p-p-xx
	$class =~ s/^(Padre::Plugin::)(\w+)(?:::.+)/$1$2/;
	my @row = Padre::DB->selectrow_array(
		'select config from plugin where name = ?', {},
		$class,
	);
	return unless defined $row[0];

	# Parse the config from the string
	my @config = YAML::Tiny::Load( $row[0] );
	unless ( Params::Util::_HASH0( $config[0] ) ) {
		Carp::croak('Config for plugin was not a HASH refence');
	}

	return $config[0];
}

=pod

=head2 C<config_write>

  $self->config_write( { foo => 'bar' } );

The C<config_write> method is used to write the host-specific configuration
information for the plug-in into the underlying database storage.

At this time, the configuration must be a nested, non-cyclic structure of
C<HASH> references, C<ARRAY> references and simple scalars (the use of
C<undef> values is permitted) with a C<HASH> reference at the root.

=cut

sub config_write {
	my $self   = shift;
	my $config = shift;
	unless ( Params::Util::_HASH0($config) ) {
		Carp::croak('Did not provide a HASH ref to config_write');
	}

	# Convert the config to a string
	my $string = YAML::Tiny::Dump($config);

	# Write the config string to the database
	my $class = Scalar::Util::blessed($self);

	#convert p-p-xx-yy -> p-p-xx
	$class =~ s/^(Padre::Plugin::)(\w+)(?:::.+)/$1$2/;
	Padre::DB->do(
		'update plugin set config = ? where name = ?', {},
		$string, $class,
	);

	return 1;
}

=pod

=head2 C<plugin_preferences>

  $plugin->plugin_preferences($wx_parent);

The C<plugin_preferences> method allows a plug-in to define an entry point
for the Plug-in Manager dialog to trigger to show a preferences or
configuration dialog for the plug-in.

The method is passed a Wx object that should be used as the Wx parent.

=cut

# This method is only implemented in the plug-in children

=head2 C<menu_plugins_simple>

  sub menu_plugins_simple {
      'My Plug-in' => [
          Submenu  => [
              'Do Something' => sub { $self->do_something },
          ],

          # Separator
          '---' => undef,
  
          # Shorthand for sub { $self->show_about(@_) }
          About => 'show_about',
  
          # Also use keyboard shortcuts to call sub { $self->show_about(@_) }
          "Action\tCtrl+Shift+Z" => 'action',
      ];
  }

The C<menu_plugins_simple> method defines a simple menu structure for your
plug-in.

It returns two values, the label for the menu entry to be used in the top
level Plug-ins menu, and a reference to an ARRAY containing an B<ordered> set of
key/value pairs that will be turned into menus.

If the key is a string of three hyphens (i.e. C<--->) the pair will be
rendered as a menu separator.

If the key is a string containing a tab (C<"\t">) and a keyboard shortcut combination
the menu action will also be available through a keyboard shortcut.

If the value is a Perl identifier, it will be treated as a method name to be
called on the plug-in object when the menu entry is triggered.

If the value is a reference to an ARRAY, the pair will be rendered as a
sub-menu containing further menu items.

      );

      # Return it and the label for our plug-in
      return ( $self->plugin_name => $menu );

The C<menu_plugins> method defines a fully-featured mechanism for building
your plug-in menu.

It returns two values, the label for the menu entry to be used in the top level
Plug-ins menu, and a L<Wx::Menu> object containing the custom-built menu structure.

A default implementation of this method is provided which will call
C<menu_plugins_simple> and implements the expansion of the simple data into a full
menu structure.

If the method return a null list, no menu entry will be created for the plug-in.

The C<editor_enable> method is called by Padre to provide the plug-in with
an opportunity to alter the setup of the editor as it is being loaded.

This method is only triggered when new editor windows are opened. Hooking
into any existing open documents must be done within the C<plugin_enable>
method.

The method is passed two parameters, the fully set up editor object, and
the L<Padre::Document> being opened.

At the present time, this method has been provided primarily for the use
of the L<Padre::Plugin::Vi> plug-in and other plug-ins that need
deep integration with the editor widget.

  return 1;

The C<editor_disable> method is the twin of the previous C<editor_enable>
method. It is called as the file in the editor is being closed, B<after> the
user has confirmed the file is to be closed.

It provides the plug-in with an opportunity to clean up, remove any GUI
customisations, and complete any other shutdown/close processes.

The method is passed two parameters, the fully set up editor object, and
the L<Padre::Document> being closed.

At the present time, this method has been provided primarily for the use
