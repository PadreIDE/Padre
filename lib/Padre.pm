=head1 NAME

Padre - Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Padre is a text editor aimed to be an IDE for Perl.

After installation you should be able to just type in

  padre

and get the editor working.

Padre development started in June 2008 and made a lot of progress but
there are still lots of missing features and the development is still
very fast.

=head1 Getting Started

After installing Padre you can start it by typing B<padre> on the command line.
On Windows that would be Start/Run padre.bat

You can start new files File/New (C<Ctrl+N>)
or open existing files File/Open (C<Ctrl+O>).

You can edit the file and save it using File/Save (C<Ctrl+S>).

You can run the script by pressing Run/Run Script (C<F5>)

By default Padre uses the same Perl interpreter for
executing code that it uses for itself but this will be configurable
later.

=head1 FEATURES

Instead of duplicating all the text here, let us point you to the
web site of Padre L<http://padre.perlide.org/> where we keep a list
of existing and planned features. We are creating detailed explanation
about every feature in our wiki: L<http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features/>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Configuration

The application maintains its configuration information in a
directory called F<.padre>.

=head2 Other

On Strawberry Perl you can associate .pl file extension with
F<C:\strawberry\perl\bin\wxperl> and then you can start double
clicking on the application. It should work...

Run This (C<F5>) - run the current buffer with the current Perl
this currently only works with files with F<.pl> extensions.

Run Any (C<Ctrl+F5>) - run any external application

First time it will prompt you to a command line that you have to
type in such as

  perl /full/path/to/my/script.pl

...then it will execute this every time you press C<Ctrl+F5> or the menu
option. Currently C<Ctrl+F5> does not save any file.
(This will be added later.)

You can edit the command line using the Run/Setup menu item.

Please Note that you can use C<$ENV{PADRE_VERSION}> to detect whether the script
is running inside Padre or not.

=head2 Navigation

  Ctrl+2          Quick Fix
  Ctrl+.          Next Problem
 
  Ctrl+H opens a help window where you can see the documentation of
  any Perl module. Just use open (in the help window) and type in the name
  of a module.

  Ctrl+Shift+H Highlight the name of a module in the editor and then
  press Ctrl+Shift+H. It will open the help window for the module
  whose name was highlighted.

  In the help window you can also start typing the name of a module. When the
  list of the matching possible modules is small enough you'll be able
  to open the drop-down list and select the name.
  The "small enough" is controlled by two configuration options in the
  Edit/Setup menu:

  Max Number of modules
  Min Number of modules

  This feature only works after you have indexed all the modules
  on your computer. Indexing is currently done by running the following command:

  padre --index

=head1 SQLite

Padre is using an SQLite database (F<~/.padre/config.db>) for two
things.
Part of the preferences/configuration information is kept there
and it is used for the POD reader.

=head1 Documentation POD reader

Padre currently can index (the names of) all the modules on
your system and it was planned to have a search capability for
modules/functions/etc.

=head1 Plug-ins

There is a highly experimental but quite simple plug-in system.

A plug-in is a module in the C<Padre::Plugin::*> namespace.

At start-up time Padre looks for all such modules in C<@INC> and
in its own private directory and loads them.

Every plug-in must be a subclass of L<Padre::Plugin> and follow the rules
defined in the L<Padre::Plugin> API documentation.

See also L<Padre::PluginManager> and L<Padre::PluginBuilder>

While Padre is running there is a menu option to show the plug-in configuration
window that shows the list of all the plug-ins.

TO DO: What to do if a newer version of the same plug-in was installed?

TO DO: What to do if a module was removed ? Shall we keep its data in
the configuration file or remove it?

TO DO: Padre should offer an easy but simple way for plug-in authors
to declare configuration variables and automatically generate both configuration
file and configuration dialog. Padre should also allow for full customization
of both for those more advanced in Wx.

=head2 Tab and space conversion

Tab to Space and Space to Tab conversions ask the number of spaces
each tab should substitute. It currently works everywhere.
We probably should add a mode to operate only at the beginning of
the lines or better yet only at the indentation levels.

Delete All Ending space does just what it says.

Delete Leading Space will ask How many leading spaces and act accordingly.

=head1 ARCHITECTURE

=over 4

=item Padre.pm

is the main module.

=item L<Padre::Autosave>

describes some of our plans for an auto-save mechanism.
It is not implemented yet. (There is also some description elsewhere in this
document).

=item L<Padre::Config>

reads/writes the configuration files.

There is an SQLite database and a YAML file to keep various pieces of information.
The database holds host related configuration values while the YAML file holds
personal configuration options.

The SQLite database holds the list of modules available on the system.
It will also contain indexing of the documentation
Looking at the C<X<>> entries of modules
List of functions

=item L<Padre::DB>

The SQLite database abstraction for storing Padre's internal data.

=item L<Padre::Document>

is an abstraction class to deal with a single document.

=over 4

=item L<Padre::Document::PASM>

=item L<Padre::Document::PIR>

=item L<Padre::Document::Perl>

=back

=item L<Padre::PluginBuilder>

=item L<Padre::PluginManager>

locates and loads the plug-ins.

=item L<Padre::Plugin>

Should be the base class of all plug-ins.

=item L<Padre::Pod2HTML>

=item L<Padre::PPI>

=item L<Padre::Project>

Abstract class understanding what a project is.

=item L<Padre::Project::Perl>

Is a Perl specific project. These are work in process.
Not yet used.

=item L<Padre::TaskManager>

Managing background tasks.

=item L<Padre::Task>

Background tasks.

=item L<Padre::Util>

Various utility functions.

=back

=head2 Wx GUI

The C<Padre::Wx::*> namespace is supposed to deal with all the
Wx related code.

=over 4

=item L<Padre::Wx>

=item L<Padre::Wx::App>

is the L<Wx::App> subclass. Does not really do much.

=item L<Padre::Wx::Dialog::Bookmarks>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Dialog::Find>

This is the main Find dialog

=item L<Padre::Wx::Panel::FindFast>

This is the newer Firefox like inline search box.

=item L<Padre::Wx::Dialog::PluginManager>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Dialog::Preferences>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Dialog::Snippets>

=item L<Padre::Wx::FileDropTarget>

The code for drag and drop

=item L<Padre::Wx::Editor>

holds an editor text control instance (one for each buffer/file).
This is a subclass of L<Wx::Scintilla::TextCtrl> also known as Scintilla.

=item L<Padre::Wx::ComboBox::History>

=item L<Padre::Wx::TextEntryDialog::History>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Main>

This is the main window, most of the code is currently there.

=item L<Padre::Wx::Menu>

handles everything the menu should know and do.

=item L<Padre::Wx::Output>

the output window at the bottom of the editor displaying the output of
running code using C<F5>.

=item L<Padre::Wx::HtmlWindow>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Frame::POD>

=item L<Padre::Wx::Popup>

not in use.

=item L<Padre::Wx::Printout>

Implementing the printing capability of Padre.

=item L<Padre::Wx::SyntaxCheck>

Implementing the continuous syntax check of Perl code.

=item L<Padre::Wx::ToolBar>

handles everything the toolbar should know and do.

=back

=head1 METHODS

The C<Padre> class itself provides a number of convenience methods.

=head2 C<ide>

  my $ide = Padre->ide;

The static C<ide> method returns the L<Padre> singleton object if the IDE
has been created, or throws an exception if the IDE has not been created.

=head2 C<new>

  my $ide = Padre->new(%options);

The C<new> constructor creates the new singleton L<Padre> object, or throws
an exception if the IDE has already been created.

It takes a set of parsed command line options as a parameter, storing them
until they are needed at startup.

=head2 C<wx>

  my $app = Padre->wx;

The static C<wx> method is a convenience wrapper around the underlying
global variable C<$Wx::TheApp> provided by the L<Wx> module.

For convenience reasons, it can also be used as an instance method.

Returns a L<Wx::App> object, or C<undef> if the application object has not
yet been created.

=head2 C<run>

  $padre->run;

The C<run> method starts the Padre IDE and enters the Wx main loop.
