Changes for Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment

Padre version numbers follow an odd/even pattern, where the even numbers are
used for the production releases of the distribution. The even versions below
details visible changes or bug fixes for the Padre IDE.

The odd versions are used during development and the change entries for them
list API changes that may break compatibility for components of Padre, most
notably for plugins. This allows plugins to update compatibility before the
next production release, and synchronise their release to the Padre schedule.

Changes which do not break API compatibility for plugins should be listed in
the even version for the release, even during development.

0.92 2011.11.11
    - Wx::Scintilla is now stable and replaces Wx::STC in Padre (AZAWAWI)
    - New Task 3.0 which fixes bidirectional communication and thus enables
      services that run indefinitely in reserved threads (ADAMK)
    - New Style 2.0 which simplifies implementations, adds style localisation
      and allows styling of the GUI (ADAMK)

      GUI code doesn't create high frequency asyncronous flickering. Padre
      flickers much less now on Win32 (ADAMK)
    - Added Replace in Files using matching logic to Find in Files (ADAMK)
    - Added plugin compatibility tracking to Padre::Search (ADAMK)
    - Wx doesn't seem to let us change the PaneBorder setting after pane
      creation, so leave it off and have an empty area rather than have a
      double-width border (ADAMK)
    - Wx constants are now Wx::FOO instead of Wx::wxFOO... and these ones are
      actually constants instead of strange AUTOLOAD weirdness (ADAMK)
    - We now SetEndAtLastLine(0) on editor panels so you can scroll one page
      past the end of the document and type into relaxing clear space (ADAMK)
    - Tabs without filename now also backed up (SEWI)
    - The syntax highligher spawns the perl -c call with the unsaved file as
      STDIN rather than by filename. This seems to make things that rely on
      FindBin like Module::Install Makefile.PL files work properly (ADAMK)
    - Some tools are more thorough about indicating they are not used (ADAMK)
    - Added support for task parents and owners being notified when a task has
      started running in the background (ADAMK)
    - Task owners can now hijack status bar messages if they wish to (ADAMK)
    - The task manager can now run without the need for threads. However,
      every task will block the foreground and makes Padre unusable, so this
      feature is reserved for profiling Padre's performance (ADAMK)
    - The advanced setting threads_stacksize allows the tuning of the
      thread stack size. On Win32 the default is dropped to 4meg (ADAMK)
    - The advanced setting threads_maximum allows the tuning of the
      maximum number of background worker threads (ADAMK)

      confusion with warnings (ZENOG)
    - improved messages in Menu/File.pm, Goto.pm and ActionLibrary.pm (ZENOG)
    - FindFast.pm: 'Case insensitive'->'Case sensitive' to match actual behavior
      of the checkbox (ZENOG)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)
    - Directory tree search result rendering is now throttled to four updates
      per second. This prevents tree updates exhausting all resources and
      strangling user input, and seems to actually get the results onto screen
      faster because there's less lock/render passes (ADAMK)
    - During shutdown, call view_stop early on all tools that support it so they
      won't waste time rendering after we have hidden the main window (ADAMK)
    - #1317 'Padre 0.90 hangs and then segfaults on i .t file' (AZAWAWI)
    - Find in Files search result rendering is now throttled to four updates
      per second, for similar reasons as with the directory tree search (ADAMK)

      on win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Smart highlight is now hidden when a printable character is added or changed
      in the editor (AZAWAWI)

      reference and stderr string keys instead of the old issues array reference
      (AZAWAWI)

    - Italic text was not being set correctly in a Padre style (AZAWAWI)
    - "Show Standard Error" in Syntax check pane now displays in output
      pane the syntax checker results (AZAWAWI)
    - Moved Ctrl-Shift-R shortcut from Open Resource to Replace in Files to
      provide symmetry with the Find in Files shortcut (ADAMK)
    - Upgrade the syntax highlighter panel to wxFormBuilder (ADAMK)
    - New leading and trailing space deletion that is faster and won't move
      the editor window around (ADAMK)
    - Added 'Solarized Light' theme contributed by Anton Ukolov ('sugar' on irc)
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Open resources dialog is now triggered by Ctrl-Alt-R instead of Ctrl-Shift-R
      which is now reserved for 'Replace in Files' functionality (ADAMK, AZAWAWI)
    - Find In Files match accounting works, and no longer hides files when we
      only do a single render pass for files because there's only a few (ADAMK)
    - Replaced references to wxStyledTextCtrl documentation with the original
      Scintilla website documentation (AZAWAWI)

    - Added a generic version control panel that provides minimal project
      subversion/git support with the ability to view normal/unversioned and ignored
      files (AZAWAWI)
    - #1126 'TODO list: does not immediately show items' (AZAWAWI)
    - Added identity_location config setting so collaborative functions such as
      Swarm can disambiguate multiple Padre instances of the same user by
      named locations such as "Home" or "Work" (ADAMK)
    - Refactored the generation of templated skeleton code into a pure
      Padre::Template generator, and IDE-aware code that wraps around it (ADAMK)

      in Perl 5 files. Please note that this is not an accurate method of
      detecting Perl 6 files (disabled by default). The previous behavior was to

      and uses App::cpanminus for package installation. It can list the most
      recent and favorite CPAN releases, view their POD documentation
      and if there is a SYNOPSIS section, one can insert it from within Padre.
      (AZAWAWI)

      event (SEWI)
    - Stop ignoring syntax checking errors without an actual type (AZAWAWI)
    - The editor change dwell time (the time between when you stop typing and
      when tools like function list and syntax update) is now configurable as
      editor_dwell in Advanced Preferences (ADAMK)
    - Replaced Dump... menu in the Developer Plugin with a more general Dump
      Expression tool so you can explore the internals of Padre incrementally
      instead of selecting a menu every time (ADAMK)
    - Added experimental config setting feature_style_gui to allow major GUI
      tools such as the function list and directory tree to inherit their
      foreground and background colouring from the active editor style (ADAMK)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)

    - Heavily refactored function search in Padre::Document, breaking compat.
      Moved function locating code to Padre::Editor as find_function,
      has_function and goto_function. Padre::Document now just has a single 
      "functions" method which does the work via the task class (ADAMK)
    - In Padre::Editor the smart highlight methods are how smart_highlight_show
      and smart_highlight_hide (ADAMK)

0.88 2011.08.09
    - Thread Slave Mastering now works for Task 2.0. This removes thread spawn
      foreground blocking, reducing per-thread costs by at least 10meg, and can
      reduce total memory overhead by 50+meg (ADAMK)

      hopefully fix Layout/Fit logic on Mac (ADAMK)
    - Padre::DB::Migrate now has a method-based timeline that is even smaller
      again than the class-based timeline that replaced the script-based
      timeline, removing the unsightly Padre::DB::Patch123 modules (ADAMK)
    - Turn off Win32::SetChildShowWindow so that ordinary system() calls 
      won't generate short-lived command line windows (ADAMK)
    - Removed Module::Starter integration, it generates evil distros (ADAMK)

      repeated by F3 with no find dialogs open (ADAMK)
    - Stop Mac OSX crashes on save due to tailing pipe in FileDialog (TOME)
    - Highlight Perl keywords using Scintilla (AZAWAWI)
    - Optional feature configuration settings are now compiled into the new
      dedicated namespace Padre::Feature so feature code can be compiled out
      entirely rather than just being skipped (ADAMK)
    - The Function List now recognises *function = sub { } in Perl code (ADAMK)
    - The Function List will interleave private methods with public ones
      when set to "Alphaetical" sort (ADAMK)
    - Background worker threads that receive a 'cancel' message while they are
      not running a task will no longer silently exit their worker loop, which
      fixes the massive thread leak we've had since Task 2.0 landed! (ADAMK)
    - Properly enable Perl 6 Wx::Scintilla support (AZAWAWI)

      plugins are no longer forced to have a submenu (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Project::Perl can now do basic intuition of the probable distribution
      name and headline module for a Perl project (ADAMK)
    - Bump File::HomeDir dependency to 0.98 on Windows to pick up a fix for a bug
      that caused Padre to hang for several seconds periodically when the user's
      My Documents directory is on a UNC-addressed network share. UGH! (ADAMK)
    - Abort directory browse tasks for UNC shares, as opendir() won't work on them
      and thus running the task would be pointless. The directory browser still
      won't work for UNC shares, but at least now it won't work faster (ADAMK)
    - Fixed a race condition crash in the Win32-only AuiNotebook sizing workaround
      logic during global destruction (ADAMK)
    - Save the window geometry on Maximize, Iconize or ShowFullScreen so that we
      retain the same geometry across a Padre restart while in any of the normal
      non-windowed states (ADAMK)
    - Adding Padre::Config "locking" to Padre::Locker to enabled automatic
      write on scope exit in a way that prioritised correctly with the other lock
      types and shares a single database commit with any database locks (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the locking implementation to reduce code complexity, reduce
      lock memory consumption, and make lock releasing slightly faster (ADAMK)
    - Added Thumbs.db to the files ignored by default on Windows (ADAMK)
    - The project manager now caches null projects correctly (ADAMK)
    - The directory browser now caches null project tree data correctly (ADAMK)
    - When reverting to the default root path, the directory browse now uses
      a null project rather than just a plain root path so that the default
      platform-specific ignore/skip rules are used the expected way (ADAMK)
    - Perl projects now correctly ignore nytprof directories, not just
      nytprof.out files (ADAMK)
    - Update session description. (BOWTIE)
    - In project browser Right click on directories as well. (SZABGAB)
    - Allow renaming file and directory in project browser. (SZABGAB)

    - Eliminate crash caused by directory browser. #1248 (SZABGAB)
    - Add Perl menu entry to deparse selected code using B::Deparse (SZABGAB)
    - Added directory deletion to the file tree, although it doesn't use the
      file operation task, so it could be slow and block (ADAMK)
    - Labels for directory tree menu commands are now localised to the prefered
      operating system terms, on Win32 at least to start with (ADAMK)
    - Because the directory tree "Refresh" operation only actually works by
      refreshing the entire tree, move it to the top search box menu (ADAMK)
    - Padre::DB::Migrate now has class-based migration scripts instead of file
      based migration scripts. This results in vastly inferior encapsulation,
      but is much more reliable and works from inside PAR and friends (ADAMK)
    - The Padre Preferences Sync client now works, but requires you to enable
      the config value feature_sync until we work some bugs out of it (BRAMBLE)
    - The main window search_next method will now explicitly not open a find
      dialog rather than accidentally not open one, and the search_previous
      method now does the same as search_next instead of crashing Padre (ADAMK)
    - The birthday easter egg now only comes up once a year, and we will never
      bug the user about any other nth popup on our birthday (ADAMK)
    - Renamed startup_count config setting to nth_startup in line with the
      other config stuff relating to the Nth start mechanism (ADAMK)
    - Adding a preliminary (broken) implementation of Replace in Files, hidden
      behind the feature_replaceinfiles config setting (ADAMK)
    - A significant number of the editor preferences in the view menu can now
      support being changed by Preference Sync (ADAMK)
    - The right margin/edge is now enabled correctly at startup (ADAMK)
    - Ensure the .pod files are recognized as POD documents (SZABGAB)
    - Update french translation (but still much to do) (DOLMEN)
    - Added a slightly odd but working workaround for a bug where
      ->SetValue('foo') would automatically set 'foo bar' instead if 'foo bar'
      was in the visible history of the combo box (ADAMK)
    - Removed the --with-plugin command line option used by one of the author
      tests as the implementation violated encapsulation badly (ADAMK)
    - Moved Bookmarks from View to Search menu in line with other
      several other editors (ADAMK)
    - Added feature_folding to allow the removal of code folding support (ADAMK)

    - The majority of the on_toggle_xxxx methods have now been changed to
      editor_xxxx names to more accurately reflect that they act on the set of
      open editors. As no plugins should be changing these anyway, the compat
      version for Padre::Wx::Main will not changed (ADAMK)
    - Removed unused methods for adding customer view menu elements. If plugins
      are going to add to the view menu the submenus should be pulled from the
      plugin and not pushed from the plugin (ADAMK)

      be able to run them. #1219 (SZABGAB)
    - Upgraded Padre::Wx::Dialog::Bookmarks to wxFormBuilder (ADAMK)

    - "toggle comments" button doesn't require text selection (GARU)

      corruption of documents into mixed newline (ADAMK)
    - Ctrl-F launches the quick search (bottom pane), 2nd time Ctrl-F
      launches regular search and 3rd time Ctrl-F launches find in files
      which will loose it's own shortcut Ctrl-Shift-F in the future #1223 (SEWI)
    - Expanding the coverage of "apply" handlers in Padre::Config in

      (AZAWAWI)
    - About dialog displays now the Wx::Scintilla version if it is being used

    - Make sure that default buttons like "OK" and "Cancel" are displayed
      when locale is set to something different than the system locale (ZENOG)
    - Padre::TaskManager now rigourously avoids the assumption that it is
      implemented using threads. Of course, it always IS implemented with
      thread at present, but these changes purify and simplify the Task Manager
      and allows someone else (NOT me) to write a non-thread backend (ADAMK)
    - Fixed incosistent use of both $COMPATIBLE and $BACKCOMPATIBLE, which was
      potentially returning false positive plugin compatibility (ADAMK)
    - Ignore .build directories in "Open Resource" dialog (ZENOG)
    - Many more classes now have $COMPATIBLE tracking (ADAMK)
    - Fix #1100: "Dies when hitting F3" (ZENOG)
    - Search: when there is no match, also give out the search term (ZENOG)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)
    - Show the 'help' field of the configuration options in the advanced
      config dialog and one sample 'help' entry (SZABGAB)
    - First version of "filter through Perl source" (SEWI)
    - translate error message in Main.pm (ZENOG)
    - fix swapping of window title and content strings for "New Perl Module"
      name prompt (ZENOG)
    - Remove Remove menu item Perl/Automatic Bracket Completion #1102 (SZABGAB)
    - Intuit project root from version control checkout directories and
      classify them as an ordinary vanilla Padre::Project, before we give up
      and treat something as a Null projects (ADAMK)
    - Getting the project for a document was accidentally path-searching for
      Makefile.PL-etc and destroying/creating the project object every single
      time. Fixed project caching, and files now path-match to opened projects
      before touching the filesystem. Many operations much faster (ADAMK)
    - Added the internals for a proper Project Manager abstraction to replace
      the current ad-hoc storage in the main IDE object (ADAMK)
    - Added version control system intuition via the ->vcs method in
      Padre::Project (ADAMK)

    - Padre::TaskManager now uses the term "worker" exclusively in API methods
      instead of "thread" (e.g. start_thread becomes start_worker). This
      future-proofs the API against potential alternative task manager backend
      implementations that do not use threads. All existing Padre::Task code
      should continue to work, but plugin authors may be impacted by the
      $COMPATIBLE bump. An unchanged new release with the dependency version
      updated to 0.81 should resolve the incompatibility (ADAMK)
    - A number of methods relating to GUI and visualisation were moved from
      Padre::Document to Padre::Editor. This may impact some language
      plugins. (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Util::get_project_dir was deprecated (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Util::get_project_rcs was deprecated (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Document::project_find was deleted (ADAMK)

0.80 2011.01.29
    - use Text::FindIndent 0.10 to eliminate some warnings #1089 (SZABGAB)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)
    - Added a dwell timer via Padre::Wx::Role::Timer (ADAMK)
    - The directory tree search box now has a 1/3rd second dwell (ADAMK)
    - Find in Files results convert tabs to 4 spaces to avoid the ugly
      squares in the results (ADAMK)
    - Delay loading some modules and removed some other entirely, reducing
      startup memory cost and IO by 10-15% when few features are on (ADAMK)
    - Upgraded Plugin compatibility detection to avoid having to load the
      dependencies and read variables from the files instead. Saves 2-3meg
      of RAM and allows better scaling of the plugin system (ADAMK) 
    - Fixed Padre::Util::parse_variable so we no longer need to make use
      of ExtUtils::MakeMaker and ExtUtils::MM_Unix->parse_version (ADAMK)
    - Support for more extensive Padre::DB customisation via ORLite 1.48
      and its new shim => 1 option (ADAMK)
    - Completed first-generation Portable Perl support for Padre (ADAMK)
    - Add support in Padre::Project for intuiting project versions (ADAMK)
    - Prevent history boxes writing a history entry for every character
      instead of every search in Find/FindInFiles dialogs (ADAMK)
    - Port the Find Dialog as is to wxFormBuilder (ADAMK)
    - Prevent directory tasks running on bad or missing paths (ADAMK)
    - Found a workaround to weird Win32 window Raise/Lower bugs, so now
      Padre always raises to the foreground correctly when using the
      single instance server (ADAMK)
    - Save Intuition is disabled in null projects to prevent creating files
      like ".../My Documents/lib/Foo/Bar.pm" (ADAMK)
    - The Task Manager will now attempt to maximise background worker
      specialisation so we need to load less total modules, hopefully
      reducing memory consumption (ADAMK)
    - Closing files is faster (and the task manager is stressed less) as
      we no longer accidentally do a full refresh twice when closing
      documents other than the last one (ADAMK)
    - Enhancement, ticket #1027 When saving a file without a file extension 
      you are now prompted and provided a list of suitable extensions to 
      name your file. (PLAVEN)
    - Restored radio select indicator to Style and View Document As...
      menus, they were lost in the move to the ActionLibrary (ADAMK)
    - Fixed #1093. The natural zoom of a scintilla window is around the wrong
      way, hijack ctrl-scroll and reverse it to the right way (ADAMK)
    - Find in Files directory recursion now happens ordered (ADAMK)

    - Padre::Util::parse_version is now Padre::Util::parse_variable (ADAMK)

0.78 2011.01.14
    - The nytprof.out and nytprof HTML report directories are added to the
      default ignore logic for Perl project (ADAMK)
    - Fix a rare crash condition when TaskHandle had no task (SEWI)
    - Fix #833: Syntax error crash padre when trying to debug (AZAWAWI)
    - Perl error diagnostics is properly shown in a help panel instead
      of being a child of an issue (AZAWAWI)
    - On a slow filesystem where the directory browser is slow to fill
      directory expansion controls, the fill will no longer be aborted if
      you quickly expand a subdirectory. Both will occur in parallel (ADAMK)
    - FindInFiles was using path objects incorrectly when communicating
      between the task and the parent (ADAMK)
    - FindInFiles was trying to use a directory node, but wasn't merging the
      file nodes together under it. Removed directory nodes until a better
      implementation is written (ADAMK)
    - Created Padre::Wx::TreeCtrl::ScrollLock to abstract the workaround
      you need to use to update trees without them snapping to nodes
      that you ->Expand, and applied it to the directory tree and
      the Find in Files result tree (ADAMK)
    - When closing panels that do background tasks, do a last-minute task
      reset operation to cancel any active background tasks (ADAMK)
    - The Find in Files and directory tree background tasks now supports
      cancel messages properly, both per-directory and per-file (ADAMK)
    - The directory tree background search now correctly clears the status
      bar when it is cancelled (ADAMK)
    - Additional fixes for maximise-at-startup issues on Windows, which
      now should FINALLY work properly everywhere (ADAMK)
    - When shutting down the task manager, force-empty the queue early and
      send a 'cancel' message to any workers still actively running before
      we send the final 'stop' message (ADAMK)
    - Fixed a massive performance bug in directory tree ->refill method,
      which was triggering one background thread for every expanded tree
      node. This was leading to thread storms, major leakage, and hanging
      of the editor when changing between projects (ADAMK)
    - When exiting directory tree search mode, we now restore the tree
      correctly from the stashed results instead of scanning again (ADAMK)
    - Open selection can now find executable programs in the current PATH
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)
    - If open selection finds a Module/Name.pm in the lib of your current
      project, it stops looking for other possibilities since the version
      in your project is almost certainly the one you want. (ADAMK)
    - Updated the Copyright notice to reflect the new year. (PLAVEN)
    - Added additional test to copyright.t to check all copyright notices
      have the current year. (PLAVEN)

    - No incompatible API changes during the 0.78 release cycle

0.76 2010.12.08
    - Fix #636: Filter too strict (Padre CPAN module installer) (ZENOG)
    - Fix #1032: Regex Editor: Escape sequences don't work in
      "Result from replace" (ZENOG)
    - Next/previous file now use Ctrl-Page Down/Up instead of Alt-Right/Left
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Find in Files results panel now uses a tree instead of a text area and
      clicking n a result opens the file at the specified line number
      as expected (AZAWAWI)
    - Updated the experimental Padre wizard API and integrated it with the
      wizard selector dialog. This is still disabled by default and can be
      enabled by the 'feature_wizard_selector' configuration setting (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix the bug of lost user selection when searching a big project directory
      and typing fast in "Open Resource" dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed "Open Resource" and "Quick Menu Access" dialogs to display recently-
      used resources by last usage being first instead by filename (AZAWAWI)
    - consider script and interpreter parameters when debugging Perl scripts
      (ZENOG)
    - Fix #814: Find-in-files result window, clicking on filename does not do
      anything (ZENOG)
    - Document::get_command now has two named arguments: 'trace' for diagnostic
      output, and 'debug' for enabling a debugger. Plug-ins that use
      get_command(1) need to change this call to get_command({ trace => 1})
      (ZENOG)
    - remove configuration option 'find_quick' (not used any more) (ZENOG)
    - Fixed #881 "Find In Files" results window should be prettier 
      (AZAWAWI, ZENOG)
    - As the user types the search term in the "Find in Files" dialog, make
      sure the find button enabled status is correct (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix #1051: Syntax checker does not return the correct error message 
      (AZAWAWI)
    - By removing -Mdiagnostics (which enabled 'use warnings') from syntax
      checker, we now get a more correct syntax checking behavior (AZAWAWI)
    - Removed custom parsing of Perl's standard error in syntax checker and
      reused Parse::ErrorString::Perl to get better error parsing and diagnostic
      information via perldiag (AZAWAWI)
    - "Error List" window has been removed since it is redundant to
      "Syntax Check" window (AZAWAWI)
    - In "Open Resource" and "Quick Menu Access" UP arrow shifts focus to
      the results list when the focus is on the filter field (AZAWAWI)
    - Moved from the simple 0 and 1 age of error 'severity' to the actual way
      Perl classifies errors as in perldiag. The syntax task now passes upon
      completion a reference an array of Parse::ErrorString::Perl::ErrorItem
      objects (AZAWAWI)
    - "Syntax Check" window is now a tree instead of a list. First-level nodes
      represent the error/warning messages and the second-level nodes are the
      perldiag diagnostics for them (if available) (AZAWAWI)
    - "Select Next Problem" is now working again after it was broken since Padre
      0.57. Removed Copy Selected/All features until requested again (AZAWAWI)
    - Removed "Errors" window and moved its only useful feature: Perl
      diagnostics help to "Syntax Check" window (AZAWAWI)
    - Removed tooltip from margin error markers as it was broken since Padre
      0.65+ (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix #957: Syntax Check should use perl given in Preferences (ZENOG)
    - Fix #1059: Padre 0.74 build failure on 5.8.9 (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor: insert complete substitution operator, including modifiers;
      underline match results so that matching whitespaces are also highlighted;
      add tooltips to modifiers; only update regex description if visible (avoid
      require if not necessary) (ZENOG)
    - Fix #922: Regex editor keeps first language after language change (ZENOG)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)
    - Update Italian translation (SBLANDIN)
    - Update Dutch and Spanish translation (CLAUDIO)
    - Update Russan translation (Vladimir)
    - Fix #1064: Build failures on Padre 0.74 Perl 5.8.9 (AZAWAWI, ADAMK, MARKD)
    - Added feature_restart_hung_task_manager configuration setting to enable
      automatic restart of the currently hung task manager. This is enabled by
      default (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix #1068: Padre Task manager fails to run tasks after stress testing it
      (AZAWAWI)
    - No more redirecting words under the cursor that are Perl symbols to
      perldata help topic (AZAWAWI)
    - Changes or Changelog files are now detected as text instead of CSS files
      (AZAWAWI)
    - In F2 help search, core module since-Perl-version string is now a v-string
      (e.g. v5.8.9 instead of v5.008009) (AZAWAWI)
    - Correctly start up maximized if we were closed maximized (ADAMK)

    - No incompatible API changes during the 0.76 release cycle

0.74 2010.11.14
    - Fix #926 completely: Esc key does not always work in regex editor (ZENOG)
    - automagic MIME type detection: check first for XHTML, then XML, then
      HTML; more flexible XML detection (ZENOG)
    - Fix #1023: Outline view creates multiple "main" on Windows (AZAWAWI)
    - Added Perl 6 Outline support (AZAWAWI)
    - Directory tree right-click refresh now triggers a "rebrowse" task to
      synchronise all filesystem changes from disk to the tree (ADAMK)
    - The plug-in menu is properly refreshed after closing the key bindings
      dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Added the experimental wizard selector dialog which is enabled by
      the 'feature_wizard_selector' configuration setting (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix #1029: '"delete trailing spaces" puts the cursor to the start of
      the document' (ZENOG)
    - Find in Files sets the default search text properly (ADAMK)
    - Quick fix feature is now disabled until it is stable again. You can
      enable it again by using the 'feature_quick_fix' configuration setting
      in the Tools/Preferences/Advanced dialog and then restart Padre (AZAWAWI)
    - The default editor font should be Consolas 10pt on Vista and Windows 7
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Fix #982: '"open file" from directory window has no effect' (ZENOG)

      Debian compatibility (AZAWAWI)
    - Bumped Locale::Msgfmt dependency to 0.15 (AZAWAWI)
    - Moved wxwidgets.pod to Padre::Plugin::WxWidgets. Please install it if you
      need such support (AZAWAWI)

      to display a better descriptive name of the padre.exe process. (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre version is now patched into the win32 executable's manifest and
      resource files during build time (AZAWAWI)
    - Directory tree: support deletion of directories (ZENOG)
    - Update German translation (ZENOG)

    - No incompatible API changes during the 0.74 release cycle

0.72 2010.10.10
    - 'Quick Menu Access' and 'Advanced Preferences' dialogs now completely
      translated (ZENOG)
    - The directory tree search now prints each directory it is
      searching in the status bar. This helps you see where the
      search is up to, and identify when it is finished (ADAMK)
    - Recognize XML files by their content, without knowing the filename
      extension (ZENOG)
    - Fix #749: Recognize shell/Python/Ruby/Tcl scripts from shebang (ZENOG)
    - Fix #898: "Find in Files" dialog: buttons too small (ZENOG)
    - Fix #1007: Output window buffering issues (GARU)
    - Fix #947: Toggling comments does not work for XML (ZENOG)
    - Fix #579: (Un)commenting comments the last unselected line (ZENOG)
    - Fix: deactivate menu entry "File->Save as" when there are not open
      files (ZENOG)
    - Fix #988: Recent files menu contains currently opened files (ZENOG)
    - Fix #1010: Grey out comment toggling in menu if necessary (ZENOG)

    - Mime type for C# added (CHORNY)
    - The help search dialog now uses the latest perlopquick.pod instead
      of the old perlopref.pod (AZAWAWI)
    - Additional refactoring shortcut: Change the style of a given variable
      lexically from/to CamelCase with two clicks. (SMUELLER)
    - Fixed crash when closing the debugger panel (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed crash of "Join Lines" feature on an empty document (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed #1002: "Quick fix" feature on plain text document leads to
      error output on console (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed #1006: F2 help does not know about 'given' (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed key bindings dialog to remember cursor position when setting,
      deleting or resetting a shortcut (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed key bindings dialog to highlight overriden shortcuts with a
      bold font (AZAWAWI)

      will have false duplicate shortcut warnings (AZAWAWI)
    - Reflect both changed key shortcuts when overridden (AZAWAWI)
    - Removed the extra warning about duplicate keyboard shortcuts for a
      Padre action (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed the shortcut overriding logic to actually work as
      expected (AZAWAWI)
    - Upgraded Find in Files to use Task 2.0, replacing the original
      ack-based implementation (ADAMK)
    - Removed ack dependency, and related File::Next dependency (ADAMK)
    - Purged all code and mention of ack from the Padre codebase. Thanks
      a ton for getting us through our first couple of years Andy, but
      we've outgrown it now (ADAMK)
    - Fixed an "Open Session" crash when there is not any session (AZAWAWI)
    - Make the use of external window for running scripts the default. (SZABGAB)
    - Save Intuition now understands that modules named t::Foo are for
      testing, and will save them into your t/ directory (ADAMK)
    - Find in Files now integrates with Project Intuition. The same
      manifest/ignore/skip logic used to generate the directory tree is
      also used to prevent Find in Files searching into your version
      control, build/make/blib files, and anywhere else your project
      doesn't like. (ADAMK)
    - Add "Create directory" and "remove file" to the directory browser. (SZABGAB) 
    - Aff "Goto Last position" (SZABGAB)

    - No incompatible API changes during the 0.72 release cycle

0.70 2010.09.09
    - The Task 2.0 API now supports full birectional communication for all
      task classes out the box. (ADAMK)
    - Directory search now runs incrementally via background task (ADAMK)
    - Directory browse no longer infinitely recurses (ADAMK)
    - Directory tasks all support cancellation, preventing expensive tasks
      building up and killing your Padre instance (ADAMK)
    - Subroutines declared using syntax provided by Method::Signatures
      ("func", "method"), MooseX::Method::Signatures ("method"), and
      MooseX::Declare ("method") are now supported in the Outline and
      Functions view (DAPATRICK)
    - Updated German translation (ZENOG)
    - Updated Italian translation (SBLANDIN)
    - Fixed typos in share/languages/perl5/perl5.yml (ZENOG)
    - Added keyboard shortcuts to refactoring features "rename variable"
      and "extract subroutine" (ZENOG)
    - Fixed small translation problem in ActionLibrary (ZENOG)
    - Fix #411: working version of the keyboard shortcut editor (ZENOG)
    - The startup splash is now disabled by default. Padre starts up very
      quickly these days, and delaying image loading should reduce the
      per-thread memory cost more (ADAMK)
    - Fix MIME type setting via menu (ZENOG)
    - mark nl_be as not supported (ZENOG)
    - partial fix for #452: 'focus order in Replace dialog' (ZENOG)
    - Fix focus order in Find dialog (ZENOG)
    - Close replace dialog on Escape key in all cases (ZENOG)

0.69 2010.08.17
    - Landed ConfigSync branch (MATTP)
    - Task 2.0 restores support for having tasks send unlimited messages
      back to the main application while they are running (ADAMK)
    - Added Padre::Task::Run for background process execution with STDOUT
      lines streaming as events back to the main window. (ADAMK)
    - Fixed test failure in t/93-padre-filename-win.t under win32 (SEWI)
    - Devel plugin now has the option to dump the Task Manager (GARU)
    - Refactored, reskinned and polished ConfigSync functionality (ADAMK)
    - Added ->status to ::Main to allow rapid transient messages to be
      presented in the status bar, as fast as 100/sec (ADAMK)
    - Fixed the file-changed-on-disk dialog: Show "Reload" button instead
      of "Close" (SEWI)
    - Adding a ton of additional $BACKCOMPATIBLE variables so that every
      class consumed by the current family of plugins has them (ADAMK)
    - Nudging up the default background thread count now that we will
      start to see long-running threads looking after background
      processes (ADAMK)
    - Allow the opening of files exceeding the editor_file_size_limit of
      500_000. The file is opened if the user answers Yes to the
      dialog (MULANDER)
    - The Task Manager now records per-worker statistics on which tasks they
      have run in the past. This is needed to support various worker
      optimisation strategies to be implemented in the future (ADAMK)
    - Added a simple initial Task Manager optimisation strategy to favour
      workers which have run a task at least once before (ADAMK)
    - "Find method declaration" will not find forward-declaration (CHORNY)
    - Task manager now has separate maximum and minimum thread counts (ADAMK)
    - Minimum thread count set to zero. Padre starts up 600ms faster, at the
      cost of the directory tree appearing 200ms slower if you use it (ADAMK)
    - Command line switch to select locale (CHORNY)
    - Added configuration option to modify the cursor blink rate in Padre
      as requested via the padre-dev mailing list closes ticket number
      983 (PLAVEN)
    - Added Padre::Task::Daemon for bidirectional communication support in
      tasks. When the task is launched, messages to the chlid can be sent
      down the worker thread's message queue, and they will be tunneled
      through to the task, which can retrieve them Erlang-style via a
      dequeue method (ADAMK)
    - Don't re-scan a project dir while changing tabs within one
      project (SEWI)
    - Show the file-changed-dialog only once per file update (SEWI)

0.68 2010.07.28 - Unstable - Post Birthday Hackathon Weekend
    - Fixed rare bug in t/23_task_chain.t (CHORNY)
    - Refactored the Action subsystem into a simpler model. The old layout
      artificially broke it up based on menu structure. The new layout
      also makes it simpler to do further refactorings (ADAMK)
    - Removed half the usages of Wx::Perl::Dialog (ADAMK)
    - Use a hyphen to a separate the current vs native names of the languages
      in the View menu, as the bracing looked weird with the bracing of some
      of the languages themselves (ADAMK, ZENOG)
    - Don't show a additional translated string for the language that is
      currently active (ADAMK, ZENOG)
    - When the advanced setting "feature_fontsize" is disabled, Padre will
      remove the Font Size menu, disable Ctrl-+ and Ctrl--, and (most
      importantly) will not change the font size in an editor on
      Ctrl-Scroll (ADAMK)
    - Added integration with the PPI::Transform API for modifying Perl
      documents, so the transform objects can modify Padre documents (ADAMK)
    - Added the "Move POD to __END__" refactoring that lets you extract all
      the POD scattered through a document, merge it together, and move it
      to the bottom of the file after an __END__ statement (ADAMK)
    - If the Open Selection expression only matches one file, immediately
      open it without showing a pointless dialog (ADAMK)
    - Removed Wx::Perl::Dialog by inlining it into Padre::Wx::Dialog, this
      will remove the need to import ':everything', saving 50-100k (ADAMK)
    - Actions now only need to be declared once, and are all declared in one
      place in advance (ADAMK)
    - Directory Tree sort order is now (advanced) configurable between
      directory-first and directory-mixed (ADAMK)
    - Moved the Padre::Action* classes to Padre::Wx::Action* as they are now
      much more tightly dependant on Wx (ADAMK)
    - Plugins will now do full compatibility testing, which means that when we
      change an internal API we can just update $COMPATIBLE in that package
      and any impacted plugins will be automatically disabled until they do a
      new release. That is far better than "They just crash blindly" (ADAMK)
    - Create a new main_directory_root settting distinct from the existing
      default_projects_directory one, specifically for setting the default
      root of the directory tree. It will continue to be pointed to
      my_documents by default (the original may change) (ADAMK)
    - Made Padre::Wx::Dialog::ModuleStart configuration translation-safe (ZENOG)
    - Updated German translation (ZENOG)
    - Add Java and BibTeX to MIME types (ZENOG)
    - Ack ("find in files") output is now more 'clickable', but still not
      perfect (ZENOG)
    - Fix File::Open3::open3() call to be IPC::Open3::open3() (BRICAS)
    - Fix #969: crash when switching language after using Ack (ZENOG)
    - Remove unnecessary Wx::gettext calls from Padre::Wx::Dialog::Preferences
      that lead to missing translations (ZENOG)
    - Description field is hidden by default in the regex editor dialog.
      A checkbox now optionally toggles its visibility (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Wx::FindResult: Get rid of global variable, shorter column
      titles, both columns now wxLIST_AUTOSIZE (ZENOG)
    - Call relocale() for all elements of the Bottom panel (ZENOG)
    - Remember sorting order in session manager (SEWI) 
    - Nicer workflow for renaming variables: Now we check for some conditions
      before prompting the user for a name; renamed function
      'lexical_variable_replacement' to 'rename_variable' (ZENOG)
    - Simplify the code for the Bottom pane a bit (-1 method), no warnings
      any more (ZENOG)
    - Fixed #970: Switching language removes plugin menus (ZENOG)
    - Padre::MimeTypes: Fixed some Wx::gettext handling problems, switched
      keys of menu_view_mimes() so that the names (not the MIME types) of
      file types are shown in the View menu (ZENOG)
    - Documentation of Padre::Current (SEWI)
    - Include only changed files in changed-file-list (SEWI)
    - Added wxwidgets.pod which contains the method documentation of all Wx
      classes (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre has wxWidgets method documentation in F2 help search (AZAWAWI)
    - Added Padre::Wx::Nth to group first/nth-time startup magic (ADAMK)
    - Fixed #781 : Unicode should not be used for accessing file system on
      Win32 (CHORNY)
    - The New Installation Survey now only appears on the third time that
      Padre starts, so it doesn't confuse people with locale issues (ADAMK)
    - Split Padre::Wx::Dialog::WhereFrom into main and FBP classes to try
      out the designer-based approach experimentally (ADAMK)
    - Tab width is configurable for opened file too (CHORNY)

0.67 2010.07.27
    - 0.67 never made it to public release.  All changes listed for 0.68 are what 0.67
      would have had.

0.66 2010.07.01
    - Improved the quality and integration of the default window size (ADAMK)
    - The non-blocking IO upgrade in 0.65 meant that Padre could no longer
      open files on Windows. Fixed (ADAMK)
    - Minor improvements to the About dialog (ADAMK)

0.65 2010.07.01
    - Task 2.0 API landed on trunk (and everything breaks) (ADAMK)
    - Converted the FunctionList GUI component to work via a task (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Role::Task role added to allow any object in Padre
      to be the "owner" of task and automatically handle which
      tasks are still relevant to the UI state at the time the task
      is completed, and ignore the ones that aren't (ADAMK)
    - New compulsory Padre::Wx::Role::View for editor GUI componants
      that want to live in the left/right/bottom tool panels (ADAMK)
    - Renamed a number of classes to simpler names. Because we are
      breaking everything anyway, this is an opportune time to lump
      in these low-importance changes (ADAMK)
    - Padre::DocBrowser --> Padre::Browser (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Wx::DocBrowser --> Padre::Wx::Browser (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Wx::Role::MainChild --> Padre::Wx::Role::Main (ADAMK)
    - Language-specific task sub-classes now live under the document class
      instead of under the Padre::Task tree, to encourage concentration
      of language-specific code within the document tree (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Task::Perl::Syntax --> Padre::Document::Perl::Syntax (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Task::Perl::Outline --> Padre::Document::Perl::Outline (ADAMK)
    - Startup config file now uses a custom hyper-minimalist format
      which avoids the need to load YAML::Tiny before the first thread
      spawn, saving about 400k per thread (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Logger now allows the PADRE_DEBUG environment variable to be
      set to a specific class name, enabling logging only for that class.
      This simplies tracing around a specific problem now that the number
      of classes with debugging hooks is getting large (ADAMK)
    - Moved the startup tool enabling of the syntax check and error list
      from the startup timer to the constructor, and prevent them from
      writing back to the config. We no longer need to write the config
      at all during startup, making startup faster (ADAMK)
    - Scroll the output window down on outputs (kthakore)
    - Directory browser rewritten to operate in the background (ADAMK)
    - Improved directory tree search to take advantage of new background
      file scanning. It is now instantaneously quick (ADAMK)
    - Added the PPI::Cache API to provide a simple common mechanism for
      stashing GUI model data such that all cache data can be cleaned up in
      one go when the relevant project or document is released (ADAMK)
    - Fixing some new bugs or adding temporary workarounds for them (SEWI)
    - Rebuild History using non-blocking IO on Padre start (SEWI)

0.64 2010.06.12

      stretched middle column. (PLAVEN)
    - Add a warning for versions of Wx.pm with broken HTML rendering
      (ZENOG)
    - Mousing over a sub/method name with ctrl pressed now highlights it
      to indicate it can be clicked on (Sam Crawley) 
    - Regex editor: Support global flag for substitute (ZENOG)
    - Updated Turkish translation (Burak Gürsoy)
 
0.61 2010.05.12
    - MIME types: added a few C++ file extensions, added LaTeX .sty files
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - About dialog: increase height of the window so that the translated
      licensing terms also fit in without a scrollbar (Zeno Gantner)
    - Debugger: improved variable detection in the document (Zeno Gantner)
    - Menu: More consistent capitalization of menu entries (Zeno Gantner)

      adding an outline cache (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #541: "wrong outline can get displayed for a document"
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #940: "crashes when right clicking in code editing area"
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #878: "Tabs like 'Outline', 'Functions'... should have
      a close button, just like the documents tabs" (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed behaviour of the close button for the bottom tabs (Output,
      Errors, Syntax Check): closing a tab now toggles the corresponding
      menu and config items (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated German translation (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated Chinese translation (Chuanren Wu)
    - fixed ticket #939: "Padre 'help' depends on POD2-Base on Strawberry
      Perl on Windows XP" (ADAMK)
    - Updated Italian translation (SBLANDIN)
    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation (GARU)
    - Updated Dutch translation (Dirk De Nijs)
    - Updated Spanish translation (ENELL)

0.60 2010.04.20
    - Add FTP connection caching/sharing (SEWI)
    - Add interactive template functions (SEWI)
    - Fixed ticket #900: opening binary files may crash Padre (Zeno Gantner)
    - Improved some menu entries: added missing "...", better labels, better
      comments (Zeno Gantner)
    - Clearer error message if debugger is not started yet (Zeno Gantner)
    - Complete language/locale switch on Unix platforms: also correctly
      translate the Wx default labels (Zeno Gantner)
    - Fixed ticket #921: regex syntax error in Regex Editor
      (reported by leprevost)
    - Updated German and Turkish translation (Zeno Gantner, SEWI and Burak
      Gürsoy)
    - Added licensing information to About dialog (Zeno Gantner)
    - Skip '.' when indexing installed modules in @INC (dam)
    - Fixed bug related to search history (Sam Crawley)
    - Added file type filter "script file" (which includes Unix shell scripts
      and Windows .bat files) to the Open dialog (Zeno Gantner)
    - MIME types: added .mo to the list of binary file extensions, 
      improved/gettext-ified some descriptions, changed LaTeX extension from
      latex to tex (Zeno Gantner)
    - Autocomplete no longer displays the dialog when only one option is
      available (unless 'Autocomplete while typing' is on) (Sam Crawley - #927)

0.59 2010.03.31 
    - Don't crash open file list dialog on unsaved files or without
      files (SEWI)
    - Added a small survey for new Padre installation (SEWI)
    - Resolved the clash between threads and SQLite by temporarily
      disconnecting from SQLite during a thread spawn (ADAMK)
    - Slave master quick-spawning in Padre::Startup, so that
      we get smaller thread spawn memory penalty from the
      interpreter copy. On Win32 the per-thread cost drops from
      34.1meg to 20meg with a reduction in total memory use for a
      typical user of about 20% (ADAMK)
    - Add language names/translated texts to select_language list (SEWI)
    - Fixed ticket #865 Wrong document type in View Document As (PLAVEN)
    - New Padre::Wx::Display screen geometry library for handling multiple
      screens, weird geometry setups and other weird stuff that coders
      have on their development setups. Padre's main window uses this to
      calculate an elegant golden-ratio uniform-margin default position
      and size (ADAMK)
    - When showing a toolbar panel for the first time, make sure it's lock
      state is consistent with the main_lockinterface config setting (ADAMK)
    - Local file and remote file installation switched from pip to
      cpanm (ADAMK)
    - Completed the 'Insert Special Value' functionality (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated German translation (Zeno Gantner)
    - When refresh_windowlist was sped up, sorting regressed. Fixed (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #889: Padre saves non-ASCII characters as \x{XXXX} (AZAWAWI)
    - New Win32 launcher #677: the Padre process is now named "padre.exe"
      in the Task Manager (instead of wperl.exe) and it embeds the Perl
      interpreter instead of being just a launcher (DOLMEN)
    - On Win32 the manifest file (which tells Windows to use new Vista/7
      styles on such systems) is now embedded as a resource in the binary, so
      any wperl.exe.manifest containing the string 'name="Padre"' is obsolete
      and must be removed (DOLMEN)
    - Fixed ticket #904: Win32 taskbar icon is only 16x16 (Windows 7 may uses
      48x48) (AZAWAWI)
    - Small improvements/fixes to some dialogs: Refactoring, Open URL, Goto,
      Save as, Preferences, Insert File, New Perl Distribution (Zeno Gantner)
    - New document statistics dialog, faster computation of document statistics
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - Added missing File::pushd Padre dependency (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #894: search for non-ASCII characters (Zeno Gantner)

0.58 2010.03.08  **WARNING Still not stable**
    - Fixed "Open File In Existing Padre" for non-win32 (PDONELAN)
    - In advanced preferences, display the storage backend name when it is
      default and 'User' is now called 'Overriden' (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, display preferences options for non-boolean
      settings (AZAWAWI) 
    - In advanced preferences, display a True/False radio button for boolean
      settings (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed an incorrect default value display bug in advanced preferences
      when it is toggled (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, hide bottom controls at startup (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, Set button is hidden when it is a boolean. 
      True/false radio buttons handle the switch instead (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #858 Recent files does not display anything on Padre startup
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Refresh all menus at startup. This prevents "nothing" open mode (i.e. no
      document) from incorrectly showing an enabled menubar (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Util::share() can now get the name of a plugin (e.g. 'Perl6') and
      return the share directory of that plugin (SZABGAB)
    - Removed the unused concept of user-configurable menus, which was slowing
      down a ton of different operations that needed a menu refresh (ADAMK)
    - Removed ->refresh calls during the initial menu construction, as we
      will be refresh'ing again anyway at the end of the startup, and thus
      any work done in the menus is completely wasted CPU (ADAMK)
    - Removed the very expensive window list refresh code from the main menu
      refresh method into it's own dedicated refresh method. We can fire
      this directly in the limited number of situations that the notebook
      adds, removed, or renamed documents (ADAMK)
    - Speed up status bar updates (ADAMK, SEWI)
    - Warning editor markers are now actually orange on win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Landed new and much much faster refresh_windowlist (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #860: Configurable key bindings dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Added Browse Buttons to External Tools Preference Dialog (PLAVEN)
    - Fixed ticket #863: Continous warnings or prints kill Padre
      (AZAWAWI, KTHAKORE)
    - Bumped Wx::Perl::ProcessStream version requirement to 0.25 (AZAWAWI)
    - Added promised PPI lexer configurable max-length limit for azawawi (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #867: Padre dies when hitting Ctrl-. (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #807: F2 is broken (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #835: Function list not populated on initial panel showing
      (karl.forner)
    - Added Turkish translation.

0.57 2010.02.18 - **WARNING Contains new threading code**
    - Spawn a master thread very early in the startup process. Use that
      master to create worker threads as necessary. Cuts down on memory
      usage and fixes the "Leaked Scalars" warning (BRAMBLE, SMUELLER)
    - Fix pluginmanager error dialog for plugin-event failure (BRAMBLE)
    - Add status messages for Padre::File operations (SEWI)
    - Select some files to close (SEWI)
    - Select some files to reload (SEWI)
    - GotoLine is now called Goto dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Goto dialog is now non-modal lazy single instance dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Goto dialog has a current positon/line number field (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog is now more compact and it includes regex helper
      buttons (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog can now highlight matched text (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog can now display regex description (AZAWAWI)
    - Implemented Replace (aka substitution) in Regex editor (AZAWAWI)
    - Right click "Edit with Regex Editor" now works on user-selected
      text (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "headline" method to Padre::Project, which allows a project
      to try and intuit the "primary" file in the project (for a CPAN
      distribution of Foo::Bar this will be lib/Foo/Bar.pm) (ADAMK)
    - Removed the final usage of the "Provider" phrasing, and made more
      of the modules used by the Perl help provider run-time loaded (ADAMK)
    - Moved padre.exe build from bin to win32-loader folder since bin is a
      bad path for putting the Padre win32 launcher code (SMUELLER, AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Open in File Browser" in the File and right-click menu (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Find in Files" to right-click menu (AZAWAWI)
    - No need to launch a command shell to execute explorer.exe on
      win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Open with Default System Editor" in "File -> Open..." (AZAWAWI)
    - Implemented padre --reset to flush and reset the current Padre
      configuration in otherwise unrecoverable situations, such as now
      when the Swarm plugin causes the slave-driver code to instantly
      segfault at startup (ADAMK)
    - Add mimetype detection for Template::Toolkit and CSS files (SEWI)
    - Added plugin menu refreshing to the resource locking system (ADAMK)
    - Fixed three cases where code was still manually calling ->Freeze
      and ->Thaw on the main window, breaking the resource locked (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #847: "Implement Mozilla-style about:config for Padre"
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #845: Fix relative filenames from commandline (SEWI)

    - Renamed Plugins menus to Tools and moved Preferences into it (ADAMK)
    - Re-implemented the mechanism for generating a human-oriented list of
      window names (ADAMK)

0.56 2010.02.01
    - Plugins may now add their GUI elements to the view menu (SEWI)
    - Padre now displays a dynamic to-do list generated from comments
      in your source code (CORION)
    - Landed new Padre::Startup module which is dramatically faster
      when loading files into an existing Padre via the single instance
      server, and finally provides a mechanism for allowing configuration
      to disable the startup splash image (ADAMK)
    - Changed a few configuration settings to create a more consistent
      naming pattern for them (ADAMK)
    - Audited dependencies and updated a variety of them (ADAMK)
    - Ctrl-Shift-W is now bound to "Close This Project" (ADAMK)
    - Added an option for traceing Padre subroutine calls to the
      developer plugin (SEWI)
    - Uses correct make from Config.pm for the run menu item -> Build and
      run tests (KTHAKORE)
    - Speedup and less false-shows for autocomplete (SEWI)
    - Speedup while changing tabs (use the correct project dir) (SEWI)
    - Simple refocus on document after command run (KTHAKORE)
    - Fixed ticket #822: main window could be off screen on start (BLAKEW)
    - padre-client allows you to use Padre for commit messages and other
      synchronous edit events (CORION)
    - WIN32, Converted the --desktop registry code to Win32::TieRegistry 
      and removed hardcoded strawberry paths (AZAWAWI)
    - WIN32, padre.exe will run with the same UAC privileges as same as
      the invoker (AZAWAWI)
    - Disable debugger menu items when there is no document (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed a Padre debugger crash when unsaved document is debugged (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed Padre no-document crash with Find Next/Find Previous functionality
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Make sure that windows context key shows the refactor menu 
      items in the right-click pop-up menu (AZAWAWI)
    - Used Module::CoreList::is_deprecated to display deprecated CORE modules
      in help search title (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Util::Win32::ExecuteProcessAndWait doesn't automatically inherit
      the same Cwd as the parent process. Added support for explicit cwd
      parameter and make the syntax checker pass the cwd to it. Syntax checking
      of test scripts and such should now work as intended on Win32(ADAMK)
    - Audit uses of Padre::Util::Win32 to only load it via require. Added a
      TRACE warning to verify it never gets loaded on non-Win32 (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the locking for ->close_where, which should make a variety of
      functions like "Close This Project" and "Close Other Projects"
      noticably faster (ADAMK)
    - Changed func_foo config variables to feature_foo, in anticipation of
      of a future equivalent to the Mozilla "about:config" control (ADAMK)
    - Added feature_cursormemory to allow disabling of Padre's feature to
      remember the location in the file you were scrolled to (ADAMK)
    - Added a fast ascii shortcut to the very slow encode detector. Opening
      files all of a sudden gets much faster if you have ascii files (ADAMK)
    - Bumped ORLite to 1.38 to get faster ARRAY object support and
      Class::XSAccessor acceleration support. If they cause problems,
      these changes can be safely backed out. (ADAMK)
    - Fixed the mass-error-popups on mimetypes without help provider (SEWI)
    - During DB locks (which are the most likely place for things to make
      changes to the database) disable synchronous SQLite writes. This will
      reduce the time that Padre blocks, at the risk of config.db corruption
      if there is a hardware failure or operating system crash. (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #837: padre.exe should be able to be placed in
      c:\strawberry\perl\site\bin (AZAWAWI)
    - Improved "Goto Line" dialog to be smarter with better validation/error
      messages (AZAWAWI)
    - Open Resource can now display Perl package names for matching resources
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed #838: Author tests should all check RELEASE_TESTING and/or
      AUTOMATED_TESTING (RHEBUS, AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed Regex Editor dialog destruction bug where multiple ->Show and
      ->Destroy could lead to a Padre crash on WIN32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Project detection differentiates between four different subclasses
      of Perl build systems (three of those correctly) (ADAMK)
    - Function List has resource locking around it and properly triggers a
      refresh when we show it for an already open document (ADAMK)
    - "Goto Line" dialog now supports going to lines and positions (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed perl to refactor action prefix for refactor menu for 
      consistency (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #841: Quick Menu Access should show the location of the 
      menu item on the menu system (AZAWAWI)

0.55 2010.01.21
    - Add full list of file types to the View Document As menu (SZABGAB)
    - dist-zilla projects detection finally fixed (#489) (JQUELIN)
    - The directory tree refresh method will shortcut if nothing has
      changed, which should fix a number of bugs relating to the
      directory tree "doing things" when it shouldn't be (ADAMK)
    - Saving files to somewhere other than the current project will now
      correctly flush the document project state, and triggers a directory
      tree flush so that we communicate the change in project (ADAMK)
    - Cloned ORLite::Migrate to a private version as Padre::DB::Migrate
      so we have a better chance of fixing bug #796 (ADAMK)
    - Tentatively fixed #796 by spawning migration scripts in a manner which
      does NOT assume the pre-existance of STDOUT. This is at best a
      short-term hack, because this STDOUT problem is going to come back and
      bite us in other ways in the future, for sure (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the directory tree refresh logic to improve startup speed when
      launching Padre with specific named files to open (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the creation and management of tool widgets to remove the need
      to load or construct tools at startup time that are turned off in the
      user's configuration.
    - Tuned lock-release refresh execution to remove low-level refresh
      methods that are also contained in higher level refresh methods.
    - Removed a superfluous AUI Update from the refresh method (ADAMK)
    - Delay loading some additional GUI classes and objects until they
      definitely needed (ADAMK)
    - Suppress warnings that occur during plugin loading (ADAMK)
    - 'Simple' possible fix for #331 to update the tabs when 'save all' is 
      run in Padre. (PLAVEN)
    - Fixed #819: Don't crash on missing project dir (SEWI)
    - Upgrading --desktop option from VBScript to a new Win32::Shortcut-based
      Padre::Desktop. Desktop link creation works on Vista and newer
      operating systems again (ADAMK)
    - Tuned menubar refresh to only fire if we change document mimetype,
      which saves a ton of CPU and seems to reduce flicker (ADAMK)

0.54 2010.01.07
    - Added experimental support for clickable filenames in Output panel.
      Currently only matches: <error> at <file> line 5. (PDONELAN)
    - If all files are closed, the function list would ->Hide itself
      permanently and never come back. Resolved (ADAMK)
    - Fix perl interpreter selection (SZABGAB)
    - Updated DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.27 and ORLite dependency to 1.30.
      This should now correctly throw an exception on a corrupt padre.db file
      which will cause an immediate crash at startup with a SQLite-related
      error message instead of a secondary error message complaining about
      missing Padre::DB classes (ADAMK)
    - Moved Padre::HelpProvider::Perl to Padre::Document::Perl::Help to
      prevent plugin classes from being scattered all over the namespace
      tree (ADAMK)
    - Moved Padre::QuickFixProvider::Perl to Padre::Document::Perl::QuickFix
      to prevent plugin classes from being scattered all over the namespace
      tree (ADAMK)
    - During shutdown, be more precise about the order in which we clean up
      and be more careful to ensure that ->Update is NOT disabled, to prevent
      segfaults on Windows from the "disabled update at exit" bug (ADAMK)
    - Added the first PROJECT-backend config_perltidy setting, so that
      projects can for the first time define a project tidy policy. This
      project-specific policy isn't being used by the plugin itself yet,
      but this change clears the way for that kind of functionality (ADAMK)
    - Added config_perlcritic configuration setting, so that projects can
      define perlcritic policies (ADAMK)
    - All tests now run without the need for a visible Padre window (ADAMK)
    - Ticket #756: Wx::Perl::ProcessStream 0.24 solved this issue
      Changed the dependency to 0.24 (SEWI)

0.53 2009.12.23
    - Add initial version of a debugger using Debug::Client (SZABGAB)
    - Fix crashes when running refactor actions when there
      is no document (AZAWAWI)
    - Open resource searches now for user selections (AZAWAWI)
    - The Open resource's OK button is disabled when the
